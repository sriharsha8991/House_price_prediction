In this project, I developed the predictive model trained on house price data. It deploys with flask API and uses Linear Regression to predict the price value. Deploy Machine Learning Model Using Flask to take a model from python code.


## Usage Guide:
* Bedrooms: Enter number of bedrooms in the house
* bathrooms: Enter number of bathrooms in the house
* floors: enter number of floors if no floors are there enter only 1
* years: Enter numbers of years passed after the construction done successfully
**Example if it is constructed in the year 2020 years = 3**
